现在全世界都疯了
World's a crazy place right now.

11
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,480
同盟被撕裂了
Alliances are all torn apart.

12
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:12,880
世界破碎了
The world's broken.

13
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,210
象征的意义来自赋予它们意义的
Symbols are nothing without the women and men

14
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,310
男男女女
that give them meaning.

15
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:19,260
谢谢你  美国队长  但这是你的
Thank you, Captain America. But this belongs to you.

16
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,550
给我讲讲你最近做的噩梦
Tell me about your most recent nightmare.

17
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,700
听着  我知道你经历了很多
Look, I know that you have been through a lot,

18
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,870
可你找回了自己的意志
but you've got your mind back,

19
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,750
你得到了赦免
you are being pardoned.

20
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,010
你自由了
You're free.

21
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,540
我可以做什么
To do what?

22
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,960
哎呦  看
Oh, bam! Right there!

23
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,270
看到他们了吗  他们是你需要担心的人
You see these guys? These are the guys you gotta worry about.

24
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,640
他们自称碎旗者
They call themselves Flag Smashers.

25
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,040
这些人想要一个统一无国界的世界
They want a world that's unified without borders.

26
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,670
这就是碎旗者的领导者吗
So, this is the leader of the Flag Smashers, huh?

27
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,270
他力气很大
He's strong.

28
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,530
天啊  山姆  你快来看
Oh, my God, Sam. You better look at this.

29
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,640
让我们一起欢迎新美国队长
Join me in welcoming your new Captain America.

30
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,530
回顾旧荣光呢
Reliving the glory days?

31
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,800
我还记得每场比赛前
I remember sneaking into this locker room

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,800
溜进这间更衣室来见你
before each game to see you.

33
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,640
这或许就是我们稳赢不输的秘诀
It's probably why we always won.

34
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,140
你紧张吗
You nervous?

35
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,690
谁  我吗
Who, me?

36
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,750
从不会
Never.

37
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,420
我做过队长  这当然不一样
I've been a captain before, obviously, but this is different.

38
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,770
这...
This is...

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,020
全世界的人
Everybody in the world

40
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,900
都指望我是某个样子
expects me to be something.

41
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,150
我不想让他们失望
And I don't wanna fail them.

42
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,380
-我知道  -嗯
- I know. - Yeah.

43
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,190
-做自己  -嗯
- Be yourself. - Yeah.

44
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,710
他们会喜欢你的
They're gonna love you.

45
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,190
祝你好运
Good luck.

46
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,240
-爱你  -爱你
- Love you. - Love you.

47
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,220
-他吐了吗  -还没呢  到你了
- Did he puke yet? - Not yet. You're up.

48
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,320
-收到  -早上好
- Copy that. - Good morning.

49
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,920
早上好  美国  早上好
Good morning, America. Good morning.

50
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,500
不对  你是美国队长  你不是...
No, you're Captain America, you're not...

51
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,440
早上好  约翰  队长
Good morning. John, Captain, uh...

52
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,600
美国队长
Captain America.

53
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,390
所以你戏剧课没过
And that's why you failed drama class.

54
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,530
-你能相信吗  -是啊
- Can you believe this? - I know, right?

55
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,710
-嗯  -两周前我们还在组队
- Yeah. - Two weeks ago we're prepping the team

56
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,090
准备去智利执行特种任务  现在来干这个
for a special ops mission in Chile, now this.

57
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,770
别误会  这很好
Don't get me wrong, this has been great,

58
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,680
很好  但我握了好多手
it's been great, but it's been a lot of handshakes,

59
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,550
好多装扮  发表了好多讲话
a lot of suits, a lot of speeches,

60
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,460
还有跟参议员见面
and senator meetings,

61
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,910
我只想好好工作
and I just wanna do the job.

62
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,820
-这就是你的工作  约翰  -嗯
- This is the job, John. - Yeah.

63
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,410
这一切都是
All of it is.

64
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,670
胸有成竹的星条旗之子  什么的
Star-spangled man with a plan and all that.

65
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,940
那本就是工作的一部分
It's always been in the job description.

66
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,710
这身衣服  是满载着期待的  兄弟
Listen, this suit, it comes with expectations, brother.

67
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,410
你今后不能靠蛮力解决问题了
You can't just punch your way out of problems anymore, you know?

68
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,510
该去工作了
Time to go to work.

69
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,490
该去工作了
Time to go to work.

非常感谢你能来
Thank you so much for coming.

79

你一定很开心吧
This has gotta be fun, though,

80
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,840
时过境迁  再回到你的高中
coming back to your high school after so much has changed?

81
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,820
-约翰·沃克  -真是太棒了
- John Walker! - Oh, it's great. We're...

82
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,370
好啊
Yeah.

83
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,940
约翰  我想大家最想知道的事
John, I think the first thing everyone wants to know

84
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,780
就是做美国队长是什么感觉
is what is it like being Captain America?

85
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,890
你走到哪儿头顶都有老鹰飞过吗
Do eagles fly overhead wherever you go?

86
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,690
是啊
Uh, yes.

87
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,680
是的  还有国旗会威武地在空中飘扬
Yeah, that and flags tend to start majestically waving in the wind.

88
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,900
巡演如何
And how's the tour been?

89
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,850
我知道他们为你安排了盛大的首秀
I know they did a big rollout for you, right?

90
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,910
真是莫大荣幸
It's the greatest honor of my life.

91
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,960
但我还有些震惊
Um, but I'm just a little shocked, I think.

92
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
我这样的人怎么会走到这一步
How did a guy like me end up here?

93
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,100
等等  "我这样的人"
Oh, wait, wait, wait. "A guy like me"?

94
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,420
某人太自谦了
Somebody's being a bit too humble.

95
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,660
如果你们不了解约翰的简历
For those of you who aren't familiar with his résumé,

00:06:45,950 --> 00:07:04,570
{\an8}约翰·沃克成为美国队长
佐治亚州  卡斯特林高中

荣获三枚荣誉勋章第一人

99
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,270
曾负责绝密反恐任务和人质救援任务"
ran RS-One missions in counterterrorism and hostage rescue."

100
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,200
政府在麻省理工学院研究过你的身体
The government did a study of your body at MIT,

101
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,230
你在所有可测量门类中都成绩斐然
and you tested off the charts in every measurable category.

102
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,740
速度  耐力  智力
Speed, endurance, intelligence...

103
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,420
是这样的  我不是托尼·斯塔克
Look, here's the thing, uh, I'm not Tony Stark,

104
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,170
也不是班纳博士
I'm not Dr. Banner, okay?

105
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,360
我没有酷炫装备  或超级力量
I don't have the flashiest gadgets, I don't have super strength.

106
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,260
但我有
But what I do have

107
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,090
勇气
is guts.

108
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,070
那是美国队长一直拥有
Something Captain America always had,

109
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,930
也一直需要的东西  我会需要一切勇气
always needs to have, and I'm gonna need every ounce of it.

110
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,750
因为  我要接过重大的责任
Because I got big shoes to fill.

111
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,310
你认识史蒂夫·罗杰斯吗
Did you know Steve Rogers?

112
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,760
史蒂夫回归时
Well, I was two years out of West Point

113
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,000
我已离开西点两年了
when Steve came back on the scene.

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,460
他做复仇者时  我一直密切关注他
I followed his career very closely as an Avenger.

115
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,540
我认为我以他为榜样
I like to think that I modeled my work after his.

116
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,460
所以你一直想做个英雄吗
So you've always wanted to be a hero?

117
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,280
我很高兴我做的事能给人们安全感
I liked that what I was doing would make people feel safe.

118
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,010
史蒂夫·罗杰斯就是有这种本事的人
Steve Rogers was the kind of guy who could do that,

119
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,310
他给了我希望
he gave me hope.

120
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,410
虽然我没见过他
Even though I never met him,

121
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,640
却觉得他如同我的兄弟
he feels like a brother.

122
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,270
{\an8}队长回归

123
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,230
看上去人不错
Seems like a good guy.

124
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:11,410
{\an8}队长回归  约翰·沃克

125
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,820
-你见过他吗  -没有
- You met him? - No.

126
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,430
谢谢你这么急能赶来
Thanks for doing this on such short notice.

127
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,010
没事  我就再检查几件事
Yeah. No sweat. I'm just finishing up the checklist.

128
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,570
你到慕尼黑后就一切就绪了
You'll be all good to go once you land in Munich.

129
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,680
不该放弃那盾的
Shouldn't have given up the shield.

130
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,920
见到你也很高兴  巴基
Good to see you too, Buck.

131
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,500
-这不对  -我在工作呢
- This is wrong. - Hey, hey, look, I'm working, all right?

132
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,130
你的愤怒只能等等了
So all this outrage is gonna have to wait.

133
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,790
你不知道会发生这种事吗
You didn't know that was gonna happen?

134
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,630
我当然不知道会发生这种事
No, of course I didn't know that was gonna happen.

135
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,780
你以为看到他们
You think it didn't break my heart

136
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,250
推出他来  喊他新美队
to see them march him out there

137
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,980
就没伤透我的心吗
and call him the new Captain America?

138
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,130
史蒂夫可没想这样
This isn't what Steve want.

139
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,850
天啊  那你要我怎么办
Oh, my God. What do you want me to do?

140
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,020
给美国打电话  告诉他们我改主意了吗
Call America and tell 'em I changed my mind? Huh?

141
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,230
是啊  重聚很高兴  兄弟  保重
Yeah, right. It's a great reunion, buddy, be well.

142
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,020
你无权放弃盾牌  山姆
You had no right to give up the shield, Sam.

143
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,940
你不能这样
This is what you're not gonna do.

144
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,110
你自己的生活都收拾不过来
You're not gonna come here in your overextended life

145
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,250
别跑来教训我有什么权利
and tell me about my rights.

146
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,780
结束了  巴基
It's over, Bucky.

147
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,840
再说  我现在还要处理更严重的事
Besides, I have bigger things to deal with now.

148
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,400
还有什么比这严重
What could be bigger than this?

149
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,070
这人
This guy.

150
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,660
他跟全东欧和中欧的反叛组织
His connections with rebel organizations

151
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,700
都有联系  他的力气还非常大
all over Eastern and Central Europe, and he's strong.

152
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,300
力气太大了
Too strong.

153
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,100
怎么了
And?

154
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,840
他跟一个网上组织
Well, he's been connected

155
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,400
碎旗者有关联
to this online group called the Flag Smashers.

156
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,060
红翼追踪他们
Now, Redwing traced them

157
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,570
到慕尼黑外的一栋建筑
to a building somewhere outside of Munich.

158
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,110
-所以我要去那里  -我不信任红翼
- So that's where I'm going. - Well, I don't trust Redwing.

159
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,550
-等等  -你不用信任红翼
- Hold on a minute. - You don't have to trust Redwing,

160
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,710
但我要去看看他是不是说对了
but I'mma go see if he's right.

161
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,410
因为我觉得他们可能是大三样里的
'Cause I have a feeling they might be a part of the Big Three.

162
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,060
-什么"大三样"  -大三样
- What "Big Three"? - The Big Three.

163
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,850
-什么大三样  -人形机器人  外星人  巫师
- What Big Three? - Androids, aliens, and wizards.

164
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,140
-才没这说法  -怎么没有
- That's not a thing. - That's definitely a thing.

165
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,070
就没有
No, it's not.

166
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,910
每次我们作战  都是跟这三样中的一样
Every time we fight, it's one of the three.

167
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,140
那你现在又在跟谁作战  甘道夫吗
Who are you fighting now, Gandalf?

168
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,260
你怎么知道甘道夫
How do you know about Gandalf?

169
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,010
1937年《霍比特人》刚出版时我就读过
I read The Hobbit in 1937 when it first came out.

170
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,890
-所以你明白我的意思了吧  -我不  巫师不存在
- So you see my point? - No, I don't. There are no wizards.

171
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,960
-奇异博士  -是个法师
- Doctor Strange. - Is a sorcerer.

172
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,360
法师就是不戴巫师帽的巫师
A sorcerer is a wizard without a hat.

173
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,280
想想吧  是吧
Think about it. Right?

174
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,550
我是对的  我才想出来的  多疯狂
I'm right. I just came up with that. It's crazy.

175
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,060
但那不是重点  这些人没魔法
But look, that's not the point. These guys aren't magical.

176
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,200
他们跟你一样用蛮力
All right. They use brute force like you,

177
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,850
就像我面前这个
the incredibly annoying guy

178
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,090
爱瞪眼的烦人家伙
in front of me with the staring problem.

179
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,000
-我跟你一起去  -别做梦了
- I'm coming with you. - No, you're not.

180
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,210
{\an8}德国  慕尼黑

181
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,160
还有一分钟下机  山姆
One minute to drop off, Sam.

182
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,920
我们怎么打算的
So what's our plan?

183
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,670
好啊  没打算咯
Great. So no plan.

184
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,040
30秒
Thirty seconds!

185
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,250
-旅途愉快  巴基  -不  你不能那么喊我
- Enjoy your ride, Buck. - No, you can't call me that.

186
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,730
怎么了  史蒂夫就那么喊你
Why not? That's what Steve called you.

187
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,970
史蒂夫认识我更久  而且他总有计划
Steve knew me longer, and Steve had a plan.

188
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,240
15秒离机
Fifteen seconds to drop.

189
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,230
我有计划
I have a plan.

190
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,420
是吗
Really?

191
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,150
什么计划
What is it?

192
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,220
好啊
Great.

193
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,120
降落伞呢
Where's the chute?

194
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,060
这里是60米  太低空不能跳伞
We're at 200 feet, man. It's too low for a chute.

195
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,040
我反正也不需要
I don't need it anyway.

196
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,970
你确定吗
You sure about that?

197
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,530
嗯
Yeah.

198
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,920
我全拍下来了  你知道吧
I have all of that on camera. You know that, right?

199
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,350
滚远点  山姆  不然我揍暴它
Get out of my face, Sam, or I'll break it.

200
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,150
好吧  往北来  来吧
Okay, head north. Come on.

201
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,570
别伤害他
Don't hurt him.

202
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,420
你又在瞪了
You're doing the staring thing again.

203
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,890
他们在里面
They're in there.

204
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,450
-那人呢  -我不知道
- Where's the guy? - I don't know.

205
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,550
但他们好像在偷运军火
I think they're smuggling weapons, though.

206
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,390
你可能想对了
Well, I think you could be right.

207
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,580
但要一探究竟只有一个办法
But there's only one way to find out.

208
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,730
我看这条路很通畅  我们上吧
I see a clear path. I say we take it.

209
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,850
我们不是刺客
We're not assassins.

210
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,280
我们里面见  随你便
I'll see you inside or not.

211
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,040
拜托  伙计  我闹你呢  回来
Hey, come on, man. I'm just messing with you. Come back.

212
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,500
看看你  蹑手蹑脚
Look at you. All stealthy.

213
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,620
在瓦坎达待了一阵  就变成白豹了
A little time in Wakanda and you come out White Panther.

214
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,340
是白狼
It's actually White Wolf.

215
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,750
好  我进来了  所以我比你领先好多
All right, I'm inside. Therefore, way ahead of you.

216
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,780
虽然不是特别理想  但很可行
It's not great, but very doable.

217
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,730
你好  你好吗
Hello. How are you?

218
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,330
很好  我错过了什么  什么都没有
Good. What did I miss? Nothing.

219
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,390
-好  走吧  -不  等等
- All right, let's go. - No, wait.

220
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,330
我有振金手臂  我拿得下他们
I got a vibranium arm. I can take them.

221
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,470
我还能飞呢  谁在乎  等着
And I can fly. Who gives a shit? Wait.

222
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,850
-我想看到他们往哪去  -他们就俩人
- I want to see where they're going. - There's two people.

223
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,640
-你就看到俩吗  -我看是俩
- You only see two? - That's what I saw.

224
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,110
-我看看红翼看到了什么  -好吧
- Let me see what Redwing sees. - All right.

225
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,490
我看看  看看红翼...
Let me see. Let's see what Redwing...

226
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,980
看啊  你现在看到多少人了
Oh, look at that. How many people you see now?

227
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,700
一  二...又来了
One, two... Oh, here it comes again.

228
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,360
-四  五  -好吧  五个
- Four. Five. - Yeah, five. Yeah.

229
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,300
他们力气很大  随便了
So they're strong. Whatever.

230
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,290
-好  我们上吧  -不  等等
- All right, let's go. - No, no, wait.

231
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,240
该死
Shit.

232
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,870
好了  我们走
All right, let's move.

233
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,050
我们走
Let's move. Yeah.

234
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,850
那是第八个人  他们可能有人质
There's an eighth person. I think they have a hostage.

235
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,060
{\an8}保持冷冻

236
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,200
他们在偷药物  疫苗
They're stealing medicine. Vaccines.

237
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,800
{\an8}疫苗运输

238
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,100
巴基  说话  什么情况
Bucky, talk to me. What's goin' on?

239
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,150
找到人质了
Found the hostage.

240
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,400
你还好吧
You okay?

241
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,550
{\an8}奥斯纳布吕克公司

242
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,150
该死
Shit.

243
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,200
我一直想那么干来着
I always wanted to do that.

244
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,940
你可算是参战了  山姆
Good of you to join the fight, Sam!

245
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,080
山姆  我是约翰·沃克  美国队长
Sam. John Walker, Captain America.

246
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:47,990
莱玛·霍斯金斯
Lemar Hoskins.

247
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,380
似乎你们二位需要搭把手
Looks like you guys can use some help.

248
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,640
你被那小丫头痛扁
That little girl kicked your ass.

249
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,970
约翰  你在哪
John, where you at, man?

250
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,600
后悔没盾牌傍身了吧
Could have used that shield.

251
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,150
你起开
Get off of me.

252
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,440
那些全是超级战士  山姆
Those were all Super Soldiers, Sam.

253
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,760
我知道
I know.

254
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,830
对了  不客气
You're welcome, by the way.

255
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,820
我没事  我没事
I'm okay. I'm okay.

256
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,900
刚才那样可不好
That was a bad idea.

257
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,680
-很遗憾红翼不在了  -你才不遗憾
- Sorry about Redwing. - No, you're not.

258
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,700
你那半机器人的大脑在想什么
What's going on in that big cyborg brain of yours?

259
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,300
在计算
It's computing.

260
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,280
你知道吗  我能看得真切
You know what? I can actually see it.

261
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,070
我能看见齿轮在转
I can see the gears turning.

262
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,450
出故障了  不转了  烧着了
Oh, they're malfunctioning, shutting down. Yep, they're on fire.

263
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,200
我们得弄清楚血清的来源
We gotta figure out where the serum's coming from.

264
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,930
是啊  以及过了80年
Yeah. And how in the hell after 80 years

265
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,570
还有八名超级战士不受控  到底是怎么回事
are there eight Super Soldiers runnin' loose?

266
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,430
计划不太顺利
So that didn't go as planned, huh?

267
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,090
好吧
Okay.

268
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,200
我们继续开
Let's keep going.

269
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,030
至少我们知道了要对付什么
Look, at least we know what we're up against now, huh?

270
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,870
我们非常确定  是大三样之一
And we're pretty sure it's one of the Big Three, so...

271
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,360
-外星人  人形机器人或者巫师  -非常确定
- Aliens, androids, or wizards? - Pretty sure.

272
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,390
巫师不存在的
There's no such thing as wizards.

273
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,370
-那就是外星人  人形机器人...  -或者超级战士
- Alright. Then it's aliens, or androids... - Or Super Soldiers.

274
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,610
-超级战士  你认真的吗  -是啊
- Shit. Super Soldiers, for real? - Yeah.

275
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,610
好吧  那我们得合作
All right, well, then we gotta work together.

276
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,020
不可能
That's not happening.

277
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,450
胜算肯定要高得多  如果我们都...
I think we stand a much better chance if we all just...

278
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,880
你持那块盾牌
Just 'cause you carry that shield,

279
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,000
也并不代表你是美国队长
it doesn't mean you're Captain America.

280
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,180
我该做的都做了  好吗
Look, I've done the work, okay?

281
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,600
你用身体捂过手榴弹吗
You ever jump on top of a grenade?

282
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,180
捂过  其实我捂过四次呢
Yeah. Actually, I have. Four times.

283
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,250
我戴这头盔就是做这个的  这是强化过的头盔
It's a thing I do with my helmet. It's a reinforced helmet.

284
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,700
说来话长  但是...
It's a long story, but, any...

285
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,930
离机场还有三十多公里呢  你们需要搭车
Look, it's 20 miles to the airport. You guys need a ride.

286
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,160
二位  加里  停车  上来
Guys. Gary, stop. Get in.

287
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,990
情况是有八名超级战士在运输大宗货物
Okay, so we've got eight Super Soldiers on a bulk supply run.

288
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,120
为什么
Why?

289
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,860
他们说他们的任务是
They say their mission is

290
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,900
让一切恢复到"闪烁"期间的样子
to get things back to the way it was during The Blip.

291
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,310
也许他们只是想帮忙
Maybe they're just trying to help.

292
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,040
那他们表现的方式可够奇怪的
They had a funny way of showing it.

293
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,970
那血清的过去可不光彩  恕我直言
That serum doesn't exactly have a great track record. No offense.

294
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,270
我们得查清他们要去哪里
We need to figure out where they're going.

295
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,610
你们是怎么追踪他们到这里的  追踪碎旗者
How'd you track 'em here? The Flag Smashers?

296
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,800
不是的  我们没追踪他们
Uh, no, we didn't track them,

297
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,270
我们追踪的是你  通过红翼
we tracked you, uh, through Redwing.

298
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,050
你黑了我的科技
You hacked my tech?

299
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,320
抱歉  其实不算是"黑"
Sorry. It's not exactly hacking.

300
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,010
那是政府财产
It's government property.

301
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,800
我们也算是政府吧
Kind of the government.

302
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,310
他总是那样瞪人吗
Does he always just stare like that?

303
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,570
你会习惯的
You get used to it.

304
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,070
好了  事情变得有点...
Okay, look, you know, things have gotten kind of, uh...

305
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:07,800
混乱了
Chaotic.

306
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,770
对  全球回归委员会尽他们所能
Yeah. The GRC, they're doing the best they can

307
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,340
让世界在"闪烁"后顺利运转
to get things up and running smoothly, post Blip.

308
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,670
重新激活公民身份  社会保障  医疗保险
Reactivating citizenship, social security, healthcare.

309
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,010
基本上就是在帮助
Basically just managing resources

310
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,380
回归后流离失所的难民管理资源
for the refugees who were displaced by the return.

311
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,500
所有这些都是全球回归委员会在做
The Global Repatriation Council does all that.

312
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,210
这我懂
I get that.

313
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,120
那你俩到底为什么在这里
So why exactly are you two here?

314
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,570
他们提供资源
Well, they provide the resources

315
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,760
我们负责维稳
and we keep things stable.

316
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,220
对  暴力革命分子
Yeah, violent revolutionaries

317
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,220
通常对任何人的目标都没好处
aren't usually good for anyone's cause.

318
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,480
这话一般是掌握资源的人说的
Usually said by the people with the resources.

319
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,320
我们有许多资源
We got a lot of resources.

320
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,330
如果你们二位跟我们联手的话  我们就能...
If you guys, if you joined up with us, we could...

321
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,570
-不  -二位令我五体投地
- No. - I got mad respect for both of y'all.

322
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,310
但今天我们出场之前  你们好像被揍得落花流水
But you were getting your asses kicked till we showed up.

323
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,850
-你是谁  -莱玛·霍斯金斯
- Who are you? - Lemar Hoskins.

324
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:44,510
我看到一个
Look, I see a guy

325
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,460
身着战术装备的人挂在直升机外面
hanging out of a helicopter in tactical gear,

326
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,560
我需要的可远不止莱玛·霍斯金斯
I need a lot more than Lemar Hoskins.

327
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,440
我是战星  约翰的搭档
I'm Battlestar. John's partner.

328
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,490
"战星"
"Battlestar"?

329
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,060
停车
Stop the car!

330
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,560
听着  我懂  好吗
Look, I... I get it, okay?

331
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,420
我明白你的态度  真的
I get the attitude, I do.

332
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,390
你没想到盾牌会落到我手里
You didn't think that the shield was gonna end up here.

333
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,700
我懂  巴基
I get it, Bucky.

334
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,410
我...我不是想成为史蒂夫
And I'm... I'm not trying to be Steve.

335
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,440
我没想替代史蒂夫
I'm not trying to replace Steve.

336
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:17,420
我只是想成为我能成为的最优秀的美国队长
I'm just trying to be the best Captain America I can be.

337
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,150
就这样
That's it.

338
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,160
如果队长的左膀右臂
It'd be a whole lot easier

339
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,110
能在我身边  就会简单得多
if I had Cap's wingmen on my side.

340
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,220
总是最后一句话坏事
It's always that last line.

341
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,700
走吧
Let's go.

342
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,240
你们肯定快要饿死了
You must be famished.

343
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,510
-饿极了  -是啊
- Very hungry. - Yeah.

344
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,370
-对  我们饿了  -好  我妻子和我做了饭
- Yeah, we are hungry. - Okay. My wife and I cooked.

345
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,290
这是按我家祖传秘方做的
It's an old family recipe

346
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,620
用的是最好的鸡肝
made with the finest chicken livers.

347
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,760
随便吃吧
Please serve yourselves.

348
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,720
想要什么都可以  什么都行  尽管告诉我
Anything you want. Anything. You ask me.

349
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,930
这有咖啡  还有些饼干
There is some coffee here and some crackers.

350
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,730
-这些够了  谢谢  -为了大业  我们愿做一切
- We're okay. Thank you. - Uh, anything we can do for the cause.

351
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,990
请跟我来
Please follow me.

352
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,140
你们都快成为传奇人物了
You're becoming a bit of a legend.

353
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,900
我听到越来越多的人
I hear more and more people talk about

354
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,460
提起你们这些反抗的自由斗士
the freedom fighters who are pushing back.

355
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,880
他们叫你们侠盗罗宾汉
They call you Robin Hood.

356
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,090
每天都有越来越多的人喜爱你们
Every day more people love you.

357
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:54,020
你们所到之处  都会有人给予庇护
You'll find refuge wherever you go.

358
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,030
我和我妻子专为你们布置的
My wife and I made this just for you.

359
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,760
一切都非常干净
Everything is completely clean.

360
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,510
-不错  -她布置得温馨舒适
- Okay. - She made it really nice and cozy.

361
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,450
-谢谢你  -别客气
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

362
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,120
老天  能睡床了
Oh, my gosh, beds.

363
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,980
{\an8}未知联系人  匿名号码
你夺走了我的东西

364
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,980
{\an8}我会找到你  杀了你

365
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,480
这太棒了
That's real nice.

366
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,760
这种食物最适合你了  伙计
This has your name written all over it, bro.

367
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,030
希望你们住得舒适
Hope you feel comfortable.

368
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,000
明天见
Bis morgen!

369
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,530
-谢谢  -谢谢你
- Thank you. - Thank you.

370
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,270
床太小了
Too small.

371
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,960
该死  他们已经在通缉我们了
Shit. They're already looking for us.

372
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,170
我要把我们的化名从所有公共交通网站上抹去
I'm wiping our aliases off any public traffic sites now.

373
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,780
{\an8}国际刑警组织通缉令

374
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,800
卡莉  我们不能在这里久留
Karli, we can't stay here for long.

375
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,520
{\an8}通缉  卡莉·摩根索  最后出现在慕尼黑附近
持有武器  请格外谨慎应对

376
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,320
六个月前  你们能想象到
Six months ago would you have imagined

377
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
会有这么多人支持我们的大业吗
people supporting the cause like this?

378
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,720
我们不再小打小闹了
We're not playing no more.

379
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,540
我们不能让那些
We can't let these same assholes

380
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,490
在"闪烁"后重新掌权的混蛋赢
who were put back in power after The Blip win.

381
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,320
全球回归委员会更在乎那些回归者
The GRC care more about the people who came back

382
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,940
而不是那些从未消失的人
than the ones who never left.

383
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,140
我们已经窥见了更好的可能性
We got a glimpse of how things could be.

384
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,650
我需要确定你们都是真心参与的
I need to know that you're all committed,

385
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,270
因为明天之后  就再不能回头了
because after tomorrow, there's no going back.

386
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,620
没错  同一世界
Yeah. One world.

387
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:06,930
同一类人
One people.

388
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,780
-同一世界  -同一类人
- One world. - One people.

389
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,680
-同一世界  -同一类人
- One world! - One people!

390
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,310
你还好吗
You all right?

391
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,540
山姆  我们去把盾牌拿走吧
Let's take the shield, Sam.

392
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,130
拿走盾牌  然后我们单干
Let's take the shield and do this ourselves.

393
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,000
我们不能就这么冲到他面前
We can't just run up on the man,

394
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,560
把他揍一顿  然后拿走盾牌
beat him up, and take it.

395
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,840
你还记得我们上次偷盾牌之后发生的事吗
Do you remember what happened the last time we stole it?

396
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,100
-也许吧  -以防万一  我提醒你一下
- Maybe. - I'll help you in case you forgot.

397
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,650
莎伦被列为国家公敌
Sharon was branded enemy of the state,

398
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,590
史蒂夫和我逃亡了整整两年
and Steve and I were on the run for two years.

399
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,480
我不知道你怎么想的
I don't know about you,

400
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,740
我反正不想下半辈子都颠沛流离
but I don't wanna live the rest of my life la vida loca.

401
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,850
我们刚被那些超级士兵暴揍一通
We just got our ass handed to us by Super Soldiers,

402
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,240
却一无所获
and we got nothing.

403
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,130
也不完全是
Not entirely true.

404
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:21,320
有一个人你应该去见见
There is someone that you should meet.

405
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,730
{\an8}马里兰州  巴尔的摩

406
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,720
-是黑猎鹰  你好  -孩子  就叫猎鹰
- It's Black Falcon. What's up? - It's just Falcon, kid.

407
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:45,190
不  不对  我爸告诉我你是黑猎鹰
No, no. My daddy told me it's Black Falcon.

408
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,540
是因为我是黑人也是猎鹰吗
Is it because I'm black and I'm the Falcon?

409
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:51,490
严格地说  是
Well, technically, I mean, yes.

410
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,740
那你是什么  黑孩子吗
So are you, like, Black kid?

411
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,680
他无话可说了吧
I got him, right?

412
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,520
随你便吧  伙计
Whatever, man.

413
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:00,720
随你便
Whatever.

414
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,350
{\an8}禁止入内

415
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:51,480
{\an8}禁止入内

416
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,090
我们是来见以赛亚的
We're here to see Isaiah.

417
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,230
这里没有什么以赛亚
Nobody named Isaiah live here.

418
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,430
我们只是想和他谈谈
Look, we just want to talk to him.

419
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,800
你没听见我刚才说的吗
You must not hear what I just said.

420
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,490
我不会让你进来的
You ain't getting in this house.

421
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,500
你们赶紧走吧
Y'all can leave now.

422
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,240
告诉他  高阳酒吧的那个人来见他了
Tell him the guy from the bar in Goyang is here.

423
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,930
他会明白我什么意思的
He's gonna know what that means.

424
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,860
好吧  在这儿等着
All right, wait here.

425
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,360
孩子挺好  你怎么认识这个人的
Nice kid. How do you know this guy?

426
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,700
以前的事了
I used to.

427
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,760
在朝鲜战争时我们有过一次小摩擦
We had a skirmish during the Korean War.

428
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,460
你们今天运气不错
Today's your lucky day.

429
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,220
他说他要亲自见你们
He said he wanna see for himself.

430
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,400
以赛亚
Isaiah?

431
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,190
看看你
Look at you.

432
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,860
这位是山姆  山姆  这是以赛亚
This is, uh, Sam. Sam, this is Isaiah.

433
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,190
他是一位英雄
He was a hero.

434
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,880
九头蛇最惧怕的人之一  就像史蒂夫一样
One of the ones that HYDRA feared the most. Like Steve.

435
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,040
我们是1951年认识的
We met in '51.

436
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,070
如果你说的"认识"是指我把你揍翻了
If by met, you mean I whupped your ass,

437
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,950
那你说得没错
then, yeah.

438
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,780
我们得到密报说他在朝鲜半岛
We heard whispers he was on the peninsula,

439
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,940
但是所有被派去抓他的人都有去无回
but everyone they sent after him, never came back.

440
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,450
所以美国军方
So the U.S. Military dropped me

441
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,930
让我深入敌后去对付他
behind the line to go deal with him.

442
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:59,800
高阳那次打斗中  我扯下了他半条金属手臂
I took half that metal arm in that fight in Goyang,

443
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,100
但我看他又想办法长回来了
but I see he's managed to grow it back.

444
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,220
让你们进来  我就想看看他手臂恢复没有
I just wanted to see if he got the arm back.

445
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,810
或者他是不是来杀我的
Or if he'd come to kill me.

446
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,740
我不再是杀手了
I'm not a killer anymore.

447
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,650
你觉得你能某天醒来
You think you can wake up one day

448
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,860
决定自己想成为什么人吗
and decide who you wanna be?

449
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,270
不是那样的
It doesn't work like that.

450
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,780
也许你这样的人是可以的
Well, maybe it does for folks like you.

451
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,720
以赛亚  我们来这里是因为
Isaiah, the reason we're here

452
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,920
出现了更多你我这样的人
is because there's more of you and me out there.

453
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,930
-你我这样的人  -我们要知道是怎么回事
- You and me. - And we need to know how.

454
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,190
我不要再谈这件事了
I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.

455
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,360
你知道他们是怎么对待我这个英雄的吗
You know what they did to me for being a hero?

456
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:02,480
他们把我关进监狱30年
They put my ass in jail for 30 years.

457
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,170
不断有人给我做检测
People running tests,

458
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,470
抽我的血  进入我的牢房
taking my blood, coming into my cell.

459
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,240
甚至连你的同类也不放过我
Even your people weren't done with me.

460
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,810
-以赛亚  -从我家里滚出去
- Isaiah... - Get out of my house!

461
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,870
走吧  出去吧
Let's go, man, let's go.

462
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,910
-山姆  -你为什么没跟我说起过以赛亚
- Sam... - Why didn't you tell me about Isaiah?

463
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,750
怎么从来都没人提起过他
How could nobody bring him up?

464
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,910
-我问你话呢  巴基  -我知道
- I asked you a question, Bucky. - I know.

465
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,960
史蒂夫也不知道他
Steve didn't know about him?

466
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,410
不知道  我没跟他说
He didn't. I didn't tell him.

467
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,190
所以你是说  几十年前有个黑人超级战士
So you're telling me that there was a black Super Soldier

468
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,490
但是却没人知道
decades ago and nobody knew about it?

469
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,630
怎么了  两位
What's up, man?

470
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,700
-有什么问题吗  -没  我们聊天呢
- Is there a problem here? - No, we're just talking.

471
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,560
我们没事
We're fine.

472
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,070
我能看看你的证件吗
Can I see your ID?

473
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,510
-我没有证件  怎么了  -没搞错吧你
- I don't have ID. Why? - Man, seriously?

474
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,930
先生  冷静点
Okay, sir, just calm down.

475
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,290
我很冷静  你们想干什么  我们只是站着聊天而已
I am calm. What do you want? We're just standing and talking.

476
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,800
-把你的证件给他  我们就能走了  -我他妈才不要
- Give him your ID so we can leave. - No. I'm not giving him shit.

477
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,760
-我们只是在聊天  -他缠着你不放吗
- We're just talking. - Is he bothering you?

478
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:06,260
他没有缠着我不放  你知道他是谁吗
No, he's not bothering me. Do you know who this is?

479
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,600
这两位是复仇者
These guys are Avengers.

480
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,290
天啊  实在是对不起  威尔逊先生
Oh, God, I am so sorry, Mr. Wilson.

481
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,590
没戴护目镜我都认不出您了
I didn't recognize you without the goggles.

482
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,480
实在抱歉
I'm really, really sorry about this.

483
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:23,660
两位先在这等一下好吗
Guys, just wait here, okay? Just...

484
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,090
我没跟任何人说
I didn't... I didn't tell anybody

485
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,950
因为他已经受了太多苦
because he had already been through enough.

486
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,040
巴恩斯先生
Mr. Barnes,

487
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,390
我们有一张你的逮捕令
there's a warrant out for your arrest.

488
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,610
总统都已经赦免他了
Look, the president pardoned him for all that.

489
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:47,390
不  是因为你没去法庭强制的心理治疗
Not for that. You missed your court-mandated therapy.

490
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,310
你没在规定的时间跟假释官报到
It's like missing a check-in with your PO.

491
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,140
很抱歉  巴纳斯先生  你被捕了
I'm sorry, Mr. Barnes, you're under arrest.

492
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,640
山姆  久仰大名
Sam. I've heard a lot about you.

493
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,690
我是雷纳医生  詹姆斯的心理医生
I'm Dr. Raynor. I'm James's therapist.

494
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,710
幸会  感谢你捞他出来
So nice to meet you. Thank you for getting him out.

495
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,400
不是我
That was not me.

496
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,230
克里斯蒂娜
Christina.

497
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,610
很高兴再次见到你
It's great to see you again.

498
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,700
开玩笑吧  你认识他
You gotta be kidding me. You know him?

499
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,900
对  我们以前一起出过外勤
Yeah, we did some field ops back in the day.

500
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,730
我听说你在给巴基做心理治疗
I heard you were working with Bucky,

501
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,270
所以我觉得我该出手了
so I thought I'd step in.

502
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,080
巴基不需要再严格按时去见你了
Bucky's not gonna be following a strict schedule any longer.

503
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,350
治疗还没结束呢  谁批准的
We haven't finished our work. Who authorized this?

504
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,100
他这样的人才不应该被束缚
He's too valuable of an asset to have tied up.

505
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,330
你就给他治疗完
Just do whatever you got to do with him,

506
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,480
然后把他交给我
then send him off to me.

507
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,100
我跟他还有事没解决
Got some unfinished business, him and I.

508
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,150
你也是  威尔逊  我在外面等你们
You too, Wilson. I'll be outside.

509
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,730
詹姆斯  放了你的条件是
James, condition of your release,

510
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,940
现在开始心理咨询  你也一样  山姆
session now. You too, Sam.

511
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,400
好的  我会在外面和...
That's okay. I'll be out here with...

512
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,270
我不是在和你商量
That wasn't a request.

513
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,420
那么
So...

514
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,070
谁想先说
Who would like to start?

515
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,500
好了  雷纳医生
All right, look, Dr. Raynor?

516
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:42,730
我知道你为什么想让我和这位
I get it, why you want me to talk to

517
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,390
时常脱线的怪人谈话
Freaky Magoo over here.

518
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,060
但是我心理非常健康
But I'm 100% fine.

519
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,650
我的职责就是确认你真的没问题
It is my job to make sure that you're okay.

520
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,320
所以  虽然有点不专业
And so, yeah, this may be slightly unprofessional,

521
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,720
但是只有通过这一方式
but it's the only way that I can see

522
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,760
我才能知道你是否能克服内心恐惧
if you're getting over whatever's eating at you.

523
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,740
-这太扯了  -我同意
- This is ridiculous. - Yeah. I agree.

524
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,830
看到了吗  已经有进展了
See? Making progress already.

525
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,950
那么  谁想先来
So, who wants to go first?

526
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,780
没人主动来吗
No volunteers?

527
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,450
真是意外
Wow. How surprising.

528
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:17,220
好  我们现在做个练习
Okay. We're going to do an exercise.

529
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,620
每当有夫妻想搞清楚
It's something I use with couples

530
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,110
他们想共同构建怎样的生活时
when they are trying to figure out

531
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,580
我都会用这个练习
what kind of life they wanna build together.

532
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:26,650
你们听说过奇迹问题吗
Are you familiar with the miracle question?

533
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,990
-闻所未闻  -见所未见
- Absolutely not. - Of course not.

534
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,870
这个练习是这样的
Okay, it goes like this.

535
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:34,040
假设在你睡觉的时候出现了一个奇迹
Suppose that while you're sleeping, a miracle occurs.

536
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,880
你醒来之后
When you wake up,

537
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,220
你希望看到什么
what is something that you would like to see

538
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,050
能让你的生活变好的事
that would make your life better?

539
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,510
我的奇迹就是  他能少说点话
In my miracle, he would... he would talk less.

540
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,160
和我想说的一模一样  真够讽刺的
Exactly what I was gonna say. Isn't that ironic?

541
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,130
是你们俩逼我的
You guys are leaving me with no choice.

542
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,060
现在该进行灵魂凝视练习了
It's time for the soul-gazing exercise.

543
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,970
-我更喜欢这个  -天哪  他肯定会喜欢的
- I like this better. - Oh, God. He's gonna love this.

544
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:52,790
-我准备好了  -这正合你的口味
- Yeah, I'm ready. - This is right up your alley.

545
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,400
转过来  面对彼此
Turn around. Face each other.

546
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,970
你肯定会乐在其中
You should really enjoy this.

547
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:57,820
可不是嘛
I'm going to.

548
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,210
我知道你会
I know you are.

549
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,910
山姆  面对面
Sam. Face each other.

550
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,510
来吧  试试灵魂凝视
Let's do it. Let's stare.

551
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,910
-靠近点  -这个练习真不错  谢谢你医生
- Get close. -This is a good exercise. Thanks, Doc.

552
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,800
很好  再靠近点
All right, good. All right, get close.

553
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,490
再靠近一点点
Come on, a little closer.

554
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,550
你的腿想放哪边
Which way you want to go?

555
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,570
-右还是左  -你的腿怎么是张开的
- Right or left? - Why're your legs open?

556
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,730
这样  你满意了吗
You know what? Fine. Here. You happy now?

557
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,620
-行了  -就这样
- All right. - All right.

558
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,930
-很好  -我们动不了了
- Good. Fine. - We're locked in.

559
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,300
-有点近了  -是非常近
- That's a little close. - That's very close.

560
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,180
不正合你意吗
That's what you wanted, right?

561
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,120
两位
Guys.

562
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,580
很好  现在看着彼此
Good. Now look at each other.

563
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,280
你们要看着对方的眼睛
You need to look at each other in the eyes.

564
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,800
你看  也没有那么难
There, you see? That wasn't so hard.

565
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,340
等等  你们在干什么
Wait, what are you doing?

566
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,090
你们俩在瞪眼比赛吗
Are you having a staring contest?

567
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:50,430
眨眨眼  上帝啊
Just blink. Sweet Jesus.

568
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:55,840
好了  詹姆斯  山姆哪里惹到你了
All right, James, why does Sam aggravate you?

569
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,500
别说幼稚的话
And don't say something childish.

570
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,390
你为什么放弃了盾牌
Why did you give up that shield?

571
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,670
你为什么要这么在意
Why are you making such a big deal

572
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,800
一件跟你没有任何关系的事
out of something that has nothing to do with you?

573
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,550
史蒂夫相信你
Steve believed in you.

574
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,610
他信任你
He trusted you.

575
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,950
他把盾给你是有原因的
He gave you that shield for a reason.

576
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,940
那块盾  那是他守护的一切
That shield, that is... that is everything he stood for.

577
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,920
那是他的传承
That is his legacy.

578
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:22,960
他把盾给了你
He gave you that shield,

579
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,850
你却根本不当一回事  直接扔了
and you threw it away like it was nothing.

580
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,370
-闭嘴  -也许他是看错你了
- Shut up. - So maybe he was wrong about you.

581
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,370
如果他看错了你
And if he was wrong about you,

582
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,820
那他也看错了我
then he was wrong about me.

583
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,170
说完了吗
You finished?

584
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,290
-嗯  -很好
- Yeah. - All right, good.

585
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,750
也许你和史蒂夫
Maybe this is something you or Steve

586
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,730
永远不可能理解
will never understand.

587
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:50,490
但是你能不能接受  我做了我认为正确的选择
But can you accept that I did what I thought was right?

588
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,340
医生  我不想再这样浪费时间了
You know what, Doc? I don't have time for this.

589
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:02,140
我们还有很重要的事要做
We have some real serious shit going on.

590
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:03,830
不如这样吧
So how about this?

591
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,850
这件事我再也不纠结了
I will squash it right now.

592
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,830
我们办完那件事以后
We go deal with that, and when we're done,

593
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,030
就分道扬镳  享受一段漫长的假期
we both can go on separate, long vacations

594
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,980
永不相见了
and never see each other again.

595
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,720
-这主意不错  -很好
- I like that. - Great.

596
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,150
那我们开始吧
Well, let's get to work.

597
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,380
医生  谢谢你弄了这一出尴尬事
Thanks, Doc, for making it weird.

598
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,970
我感觉可是好多了
I feel much better.

599
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,760
我在外面等你
I'll see you outside.

600
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,970
谢谢你才是
Thank you.

601
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,260
真是太好了
That was really great.

602
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,860
我熟悉这个表情  怎么了
I know that look. What's wrong?

603
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,670
第二条规则是什么来着
What was rule number two again?

604
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,720
不许让任何人受伤
Don't hurt anyone.

605
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:49,990
再见  医生
Goodbye, Doc.

606
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,120
我觉得好多了
Well, I feel better.

607
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,300
我觉得糟透了
I feel awful.

608
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,660
先生们
Gentlemen.

609
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,380
再次见到你们真是太好了
Good to see you again.

610
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,780
如果我们搞分裂  就只会失败
Look, if we divide ourselves, we don't stand a chance,

611
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,250
你们都很清楚的
you guys know that.

612
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,370
那现在是什么情况
So what do you got?

613
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,310
他们的领导者名叫卡莉·摩根索
Well, the leader's name's Karli Morgenthau.

614
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:20,980
我们一直在追查那些
We've been targeting civilians

615
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,380
帮助卡莉四处流窜的平民
who've been helping Karli move from place to place.

616
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,100
他们标记一个地点  然后干扰信号
They geotagged a location, then scrambled the signal.

617
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,670
但是我们的卫星在欧洲中部和东部的
But our satellites have found their symbol popping up

618
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,410
多个回归安置社区
in various displaced communities

619
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,730
发现了他们的象征
all across Central and Eastern Europe.

620
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,030
我们觉得她把刚偷的药
We think that she's taking the medicine

621
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,840
带到了其中一个营地里
she just stole to one of these camps.

622
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,230
"闪烁"之后
Well, there are hundreds of those

623
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,040
全球冒出了几百个这种营地
all over the planet since The Blip.

624
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,090
看来你们得费大功夫好好找了
So I guess you'll have to look real hard.

625
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,080
幸好我的视力特别棒
Good thing I have 20/20 vision, huh?

626
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,210
她现在在哪里  沃克
Where is she now, Walker?

627
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:45,360
-你知道吗  -我们不知道  巴基
- Do you know? - No, we don't know, Bucky.

628
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,340
但我们迟早会找到她的
It's only a matter of time before we find out.

629
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,820
你肯定很吃力吧  沃克
Things are really intense for you, aren't they, Walker?

630
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,380
冷静一点  沃克说得没错
Take it easy. Look, Walker's right.

631
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,110
我们必须找到他们  并阻止他们
It is imperative that we find them and stop them.

632
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,270
但是你们有干涉限制
But you guys have rules of engagement

633
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,490
还要申请各种授权
and all kind of authorizations you have to get.

634
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,320
我们都是自由人
We're free agents.

635
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,920
我们更灵活
We're more flexible.

636
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,580
所以我们也不该和你们一起行动
So it wouldn't make sense for us to work with you.

637
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,650
那就给你们一个建议
A word of advice, then.

638
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,200
少来碍我的事
Stay the hell out of my way.

639
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,280
{\an8}斯洛伐克  布拉迪斯拉发

640
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,250
该死  我们得赶紧转移了
Damn it! We gotta move out now.

641
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,290
-他们找到我们了  -我们还有多少时间
- They found us. - How much time do we have?

642
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:40,490
没时间了  是权力掮客的人
None. It's The Power Broker's men.

643
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,790
所有人能拿多少拿多少
Everybody, grab what you can.

644
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,640
我能给你争取时间
I can give you time.

645
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,250
我拖住他们
I'll hold them off.

646
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,670
谢谢你
Thank you.

647
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,080
同一世界  同一类人
One world. One people.

648
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:27,620
快走
Let's go!

649
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,500
好了
All right,

650
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,150
站住  不许动
stop right there. Freeze!

651
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,210
开枪  打他
Hit him, open fire.

652
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,070
他们跑了
They got away.

653
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,510
你怎么想
So what are you thinking?

654
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,480
我知道我们要做什么
Well, I know what we have to do.

655
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,640
以赛亚说"我的同类"时
When Isaiah said "My people"...

656
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,840
别往心里去  他不是那个意思
Oh, don't take that to heart. That's not what he meant.

657
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,340
不  他说的是九头蛇
No, he meant HYDRA.

658
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,120
以前  九头蛇才是我的同类
HYDRA used to be my people.

659
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,540
不可能
Not a chance.

660
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,410
沃克毫无头绪
Walker doesn't have any leads.

661
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,940
我知道你想干什么  不行
I know where you're going with this, no.

662
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,100
他知道九头蛇所有秘密  你忘了西伯利亚的事了吗
He knows all of HYDRA's secrets. Don't you remember Siberia?

663
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,600
你就打算和那家伙坐下来好好聊聊吗
So you're just gonna go sit in a room with this guy?

664
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,700
是的
Yes.

665
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,480
那好吧
Okay, then.

666
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,940
我们去见泽莫
We're gonna go see Zemo.
